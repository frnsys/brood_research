other techniques and where ABMs improve:

- _analytical/equation-based models_: "cannot account for the irreducible heterogeneity of social behavior or look at out-of-equilibrium social dynamics"
- _variable-based statistical models_: "cannot easily deal with micro-generative processes"
- _qualitative accounts_: "cannot disentangle the effects of social networks and at the same time look at space, time, and large-scale social processes"

ABMs can overcome these shortcomings

areas of research, with paper footnote reference numbers:

- cooperation and social norms
    - direct reciprocity (20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30)
        - "two individuals are expected to cooperate if the probability of their future encounter exceeds the cost/benefit ratio of the altruistic act at an individual level"
        - social structure is important because it influences the probability that two individuals will meet again
        - cooperation is also likely influenced by group identity (we prefer to cooperate with in-group members); group identity can be expressed through "tags"
    - indirect reciprocity and reputation
        - cooperation indirectly via third parties, e.g. reputation
        - reputation: 35, 36
        - two important functions of reputation:
            - learning: "accessing information about unknown parties via third parties" (39)
            - social control: "monitoring and punishing norm violators through socially shared reputation signals" (40)
        - see also 41, 42, 43
    - social punishment: "individuals bearing a personal cost for punishing wrongdoers", called "strong reciprocity" (45)
        - can be via an institution (47)
        - can be combined with normaive signaling (48)
        - see also 49, 50, 51, 52
    - trust (54)
        - spatial mobility and emergence of trust: 56, 57
        - dynamic networks and trust: 60
        - agents using information of network characteristics: 62
        - role differentiation emerging: 63
    - conventions (65, 66)
        - effect of exogenous network structures: 67
        - endogenous mechanisms: 68, 69
        - see also 70
- social influence
    - segregation patterns (many extensions of Schelling referenced here)
    - cultural and opinion dynamics (92, 98)
        - continuous opinion variables, certainty/uncertainty: 101, 102
        - xenophobia: 105
        - heterogenous opinions about multiple political issues, attaching different levels of interest to each of them 108
        - individualization mechanisms, "the tendency of certainty individuals to increase their own 'uniqueness' when their group starts to become overcrowded": 110, 111
        - opinion leaders: 113
    - collective behavior
        - extension of Granovetter with networks: 115, 116, 117
    - social inequality
        - "empirically calibrated ABM to examine how social influence mechanisms can explain aggregate youth unemployment rates" 121
