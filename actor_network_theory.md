# Actor Network Theory

- refutes social and technological determinism
- combines social and technical (technological) accounts, since the two are always entangled
- describes relationships between human and non-human "actants" within a network or an assemblage
- an "assemblage" - essentially a network; actants are nodes in the assemblage
- in actor-network theory all actants (people, technologies) have an equal amount of agency and are as important as any other actant to the network
- all actants are assemblages themselves
- technical agents/technologies are "actors"
- actors themselves form a network

- excludes interactions and people that are not fully enmeshed in surveillable technologies, of which there are still (and likely will continue to be) plenty
