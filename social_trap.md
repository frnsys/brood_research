__Social Trap__
"where men or organizations or whole societies get themselves started in some direction or some set of relationships that later prove to be unpleasant or lethal and that they see no easy way to back out of or to avoid." (pp641)

Tragedy of the CommonsÂ is an example of a social trap (pp641)

__Social Fence__
converse to a social trap, a "countertrap". "The consideration of individual advantage prevents us from doing something that might nevertheless be of great benefit to the group as a whole" (pp641)

Also can be described as situations where individual action (or inaction) is in the interest of "immediate personal goals or self-interest, even rather weak self-interest" but cause "long-range societal effects which are to almost no one's self-interest" (pp641).

It seems "bystander effect" is a social fence:

Platt uses the example of the Kitty Genovese murder where a girl was raped and killed while more than 30 neighbors watched without calling the police

> "there is a certain individual barrier against calling the police. Not only must you tear yourself away from the spectacle, but you face the probability of having to testify in court...[with] a chance of being hunted down by the murderer or his friends" (pp641)

_Social traps & fences can be described in terms of (Skinner) reinforcement:_ (pp642-643)

__Skinner reinforcement:__ situation or stimulus S, where a subject emits some behavior B, followed by some reinforcement or result R. R+ is a positive reinforcement (reward), makes the initial behavior B more probable when S occurs. R- is negative reinforcement (punishment), making B less probably when S occurs.

Platt makes a distinction between short-term R (RS) and long-term R (RL)

In these terms, a social trap can be described as: S => B => RS+ => RL-

That is, a stimulus elicits a behavior and there is a short-term reward (encouraging that behavior) but ultimately causes a long-term punishment

A fence can be described as:

S -> B -> RS- -> RL+

That is, a stimulus elicits a behavior and there is a short term punishment (discouraging that behavior), but there would be a long-term reward

"Reversal of reinforcers" can also be applied to traps, where it isn't a comparison of short/long-term, but rather that personal reward/punishment (RP+ or RP-) equates to group punishment/reward (RG- or RG+). e.g. something that rewards the individual is ultimately to the disadvantage of the group.

_Three major types of traps/countertraps:_ (pp642)

  1. One person traps ("self-traps")
  2. Missing-hero type (group trap) - where one person is needed to act for the group
  3. Commons type (group trap) - where the common pursuit of individual goods leads to collective bads

__One Person Traps__ (pp643-644)

Subgroups of this type:

_simple delay reversals_ (RS+ => RL-)

examples: smoking, overeating

the countertrap of this type are (RS\- => RL+)

example: saving for old age - eventually leads to reward, but deprives present pleasures

_ignorance of the unexpected or reversed outcome_

example: a fish swimming into a fish trap without realizing that he won't be able to get out

_sliding reinforcers_

reinforcers that change steadily as you go on repeating a behavior, so that it becomes less and less rewarding and eventually punishing, however you continue with the habit hoping that things will become rewarding again

example: drug addiction, using a lot of natural resources

__Missing Hero Traps__ (pp644-645)

When group profit (RG+) is blocked by RP- for any personal action

example: "the mattress problem" - a mattress falls into the middle of the road, everyone tries to drive around it, no one bothers getting out and moving it.

__Commons Traps__ (pp645-646)

Where RG- follows because of an excessive number of RP+ practitioners

Tragedy of the Commons is this type of social trap.

This type of group trap cannot be solved by one or two heroes

Example: prisoner's dilemma, Shubik's dollar game (a group of people bid on the dollar, the winner gets the dollar, but the winner and the second-highest bidder must both pay their bids)

__Locked-in aspects of collective behavior__ (pp646-647)

immediate small reinforcements or punishments lead to self-maintaining behavior

Three types of locked-in patterns in collective behavior:

  1. Invisible hand - stabilization/equilibrium in the absence of any overt/mechanical causal mechanism (e.g. Adam Smith's invisible hand of the marketplace)
  2. Invisible fist - competing between individuals does not lead to stabilization but instead deviates to an extreme past some point of no return (e.g. arms races)
  3. Invisible chain - "a loop of transactional relationships among two or more people, forming self-maintaining systems that are sometimes very damaging and very hard to get out of" (pp647). I.E. a system where each member's behavior reinforces each others' behaviors

__Ways out of social traps__ (pp648-650)

  * Convert the delay into a shorter one (i.e. translate the long-term effects into short-term ones)
example: cigarette health warnings on cigarette packages

  * Add counterreinforcers, such as social incentives or punishments (i.e. adding new RS+ or RS-)
example: punitive laws

  * Change the nature of the long-run consequence (RL-)
that is, if possible, make the long-run negative consequence a positive one or remove it (probably through technological means...such as better medicine)

  * Add RS\- for competing behavior (basically, substitution or systems of personal reward)
example: drink diet cola instead of sugar cola, rewarding yourself for studying

  * Get outside help in changing the reinforcement patterns of locked-in loops
That is, if locked in a loop, get someone else to come in and help you break it.

example: Therapists, diet counselors

  * Set up superordinate authority to present entrapments, to allocate resources, to mediate conflicts, and to redirect immediate reinforcement patterns to more rewarding long-range goals
Basically, set up governing or managing bodies to keep things on track

example: the fish and game commissions to prevent the exhaustion of game

__Nested traps__ (pp650-651)

essentially, traps that are intertwined with each other
