> _Procedurality_ refers to a way of creating, explaining, or understanding processes. And processes define the way things work: the methods, techniques, and logics that drive the operation of systems, from mechanical systems like engines to organizational systems like high schools to conceptual systems like religious faith. _Rhetoric_ refers to effective and persuasive expression. Procedural rhetoric, then, is a practice of using processes persuasively. More specifically, procedural rhetoric is the practice of persuading through processes in general and computational processes in particular. Just as verbal rhetoric is useful for both the orator and the audience, and just as written rhetoric is useful for both the witter and the reader, so procedural rhetoric is useful for both the programmer and the user, the game designer and the player. Procedural rhetoric is a technique for making arguments with computational systems and for unpacking computational arguments others have created. (pp2-3)

> To write procedurally, one authors code that enforces rules to generate some kind of representation, rather than authoring the representation itself. (p4)

---

> Computers run processes that invoke interpretations of processes in the material world. (p5)

---

> These abstract processes--be they material like watch gears or cultural like crime--can be recounted through representation. However, procedural representation takes a different form than written or spoken representation. Procedural representation explains processes _with other processes_. Procedural representation is a form of symbolic expression that uses process rather than language. (p9)

---

> _Procedural representation itself_ requires inscription in a medium that actually enacts processes rather than merely describe them. (p9)

---

> In her call for meaningful interactive drama, Janet Murray advocates for procedural authorship. Such effort, says Murray, "means writing the rules by which the text appears as well as writing the texts themselves. It means writing the rules for the interactor's involvement, that is, the conditions under which things will happen in response to each of the participant's actions." (p10)

---

> These are expressive agents, meant to clarify, explore, or comment on human processes in the same vein as poetry, literature, and file. No matter their content, these computer programs use processes for expression rather than utility. As an inscriptive practice, procedurality is not limited to tool-making. (p11)

---

> The poststructuralist tendency to decouple authorship from readership, celebrating the free play of textual meanings, further undermines the status of persuasion. Here, persuasion shifts from the simple achievement of desired ends to the effective arrangement of a work so as to create a desirable possibility space for interpretation. ... When understood in this sense, rhetoric "provides ways of emphasizing ideas or making them vivid." Success means effective expression, not necessarily effective influence. (p20)

---

> Because people are inherently separate from one another, we seek ways to join our interests. ... [Kenneth Burke] extends rhetoric beyond persuasion, instead suggesting "identification" as a key term for the practice. We use symbolic systems, such as language, as a way to achieve this identification. Burke defines rhetoric as a part of the practice of identificationÂ¸ as "the use of words by human agents to form attitudes or induce actions in other human agents." While rhetoric still entails persuasion for Burke, he greatly expands its purview, arguing that it facilitates human action in general. (p20)

---

> Chris Crawford has used the term _process intensity_ to refer to the "degree to which a program emphasizes processes in stead of data." Higher process intensity--or in Crawford's words a higher "crunch per bit ratio"--suggests that a program has greater potential for meaningful expression. (p27)

---

> ..._procedural rhetoric_ is the practice of using processes persuasively, just as verbal rhetoric is the practice of using oratory persuasively and visual rhetoric is the practice of using images persuasively. Procedural rhetoric is a general name for the practice of authoring arguments through processes. Following the classical model, procedural rhetoric entails persuasion--to change opinion or action. Following the contemporary model, procedural rhetoric entails expression--to convey ideas effectively. Procedural rhetoric is a subdomain of procedural authorship; its arguments are made not through the construction of words or images, but through the authorship of rules of behavior, the construction of dynamic models. In computation, those rules are authored in code, through the practice of programming. (pp28-29)

> Charles Hill pointed out that images [(visual rhetoric)] offer greater "vividness" than verbal narration or written description. ... a table from Hill's essay, which he names "A comprehensive continuum of vividness." (pp34-35)

| Vividness               | Stimulus                       |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Most Vivid Information  | actual experience              |
|                         | moving images with sound       |
|                         | static photograph              |
|                         | realistic painting             |
|                         | line drawing                   |
|                         | narrative, descriptive account |
|                         | descriptive account            |
|                         | abstract, impersonal analysis  |
| Least Vivid Information | statistics                     |

> Immediately one can see that procedural representation is absent from this continuum. Simulation does not even make the list. ... [Procedural representation's capacities for moving images, sound, interaction, etc generated according to rules that simulate complex processes] would suggest that procedurality is more vivid than moving images with sound...procedural representations with high process intensity and with meaningful symbolic representations in their processes--specimens like interactive fiction, software, and especially videogames--certainly earn a spot above moving images on the continuum. (p35)

> Nevertheless, argues [J. Anthony] Blair, the ad "does not embody dialectic completely." In particular, it "does not permit the complexity of such dialectical moves as the raising of objections in order to refute or otherwise answer them." (p36)

---

> What about raising objections? One might argue that many computational systems do not allow the user to raise _procedural_ objections--that is, the player of a videogame is usually not allowed to change the rules of play. Many critics have objected to this tendency, calling for games that allow players to alter core simulation dynamics to allow alternative perspectives. ... One raises objections to propositions in the hopes of advancing conflicting or revisionist claims. Conversely, one allows user alteration in order to construct an artifact that accounts for multiple perspectives on a particular subject. One usually makes rhetorical claims precisely to _exclude_ opposing positions on a subject, not to allow for the equal validity of all possible positions. ...[Furthermore] procedural representations often do allow the user to mount procedural objections through configurations of the system itself. (p37)

---

As a further point, in discussions people often "invite other, subsequent forms of discourse, in which interlocutors can engage, consider, and respond in turn, either via the same medium or a different one. Dialectics, in other words, function in a broader media ecology...Just as an objection in a debate would take place during the negation or rebuttal of the opponent rather than in the construction of the proponent, so an objection in a procedural artifact may take place in a responding claim of a verbal, written, visual, or procedural form. ... Such objections are not disallowed...they merely require the interlocutor to construct a new claim in another context" (pp37-38)

---

> ...procedural rhetorics do not necessarily demand sophisticated interactivity. But we might ask if procedural rhetorics _benefit_ from sophisticated interactivity. Following [Janet] Murray, _sophistication_ in this context does not refer to _more_ or _more frequent_ interaction...Rather, sophisticated interactivity means greater responsiveness, tighter symbolic coupling between user actions and procedural representations. (p42)

---

> Play is a complex concept...I suggest adopting Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman's useful, abstract definition of the term: "play is the free space of movement within a more rigid structure." Understood in this sense, play refers to the possibility space created by processes themselves. ...This is really what we do when we _play_ videogames: we explore the possibility space its rules afford by manipulating the game's controls. (pp42-43)

---

> Previously, I have argued that the ontological position of a video game (or simulation, or procedural system) resides in the gap between rule-based representation and player subjectivity; I called this space the "simulation gap." Another way to think about the simulation gap is in relating to rhetoric. A procedural model like a videogame could be seen as a system of nested enthymemes, individual procedural claims that the player literally completes through interaction.

---

> Aristotle draws a correlation between two modes of human reason, induction and deduction (_syllogism_). In rhetoric, the equivalent to induction is the example (_paradigm_), and the equivalent to deduction is the enthymeme. Examples advance the claim that a certain proposition is part of a set of such (allegedly true) cases, and therefore equally true. Enthymemes advance the claim that a certain proposition is true in light of another's truth value. Unlike syllogisms, in which both propositions and conclusions are given explicitly, in enthymeme the orator omits one of the propositions in a syllogism. For example, in the enthymeme "We cannot trust this man, as he is a politician," the major premise of a proper syllogism is omitted:
>
> - Politicians are not trustworthy. (Omitted)
> - This man is a politician.
> - Therefore, we cannot trust this man (p18)

> meaning in videogames is constructed not through a re-creation of the world, but through selectively modeling appropriate elements of that world. Procedural representation models only some subset of a source system, in order to draw attention to that portion as the subject of the representation. (p46)

> Since the late 1990s, Stanford University experimental psychologist B.J. Fogg has been advancing a concept the calls _captology_. The simple definition Fogg gives..."Captology is the study of computers as persuasive technologies. This includes the design, research, and analysis of interactive computing products created for the purpose of changing people's attitudes or behaviors." ... captology is not fundamentally concerned with altering the user's fundamental conception of how real-world processes work. Rather, it is primarily intended to craft new technological constraints that impose conceptual or behavioral change in users. ... Perhaps these [captology] tools [refer to p60 for a list] offer valid ways of using technology to alter behavior. But not one of them deploys rhetoric; instead, all of Fogg's techniques use technology to alter actions or beliefs without engaging users in a discourse about the behavior itself or the logics that would recommend such actions or beliefs. ... More strongly, captology appears to rely only on psychological, not dialectical user responses. ... [Fogg] seems generally dismissive of the tradition of philosophical rhetoric, which aligns persuasion with logical argument and discourse. ...[persuasive technology also] does not deal fundamentally with procedurality. (pp59-62)

"Captology" sounds like "nudge"

Procedural literacy:

---

> "Simulation authors," says Gonzalo Frasca, "do not represent a particular event, but a set of potential events. Because of this, they have to think about their objects as systems and consider which are the laws that rule their behaviors. In a similar way, people who interpret simulations create a mental model of it by inferring the rules that govern it." In such simulations, says Frasca, "the goal of the player would be to analyze, contest, and revise the model's rules according to his personal ideas and beliefs. (p64)

In reference to the Irish potato famine; the British did not intervene because of their belief in not interfering with the market:

> The purity of British adherence to laissez-faire economics at that time offers a fungible example of how philosophies can act as logics of political thought and action. In this case, laissez-faire offered a logic for reasoning about social and political problems. ... The rules of political behavior are an example of a procedural system that underwrites political, economic, and daily practice. Of course, a computer is not enforcing these rules; rather, they are driven by social, cultural, and political convention. (p72)

---

> Hidden procedural systems that drive social, political, or cultural behavior are often called _ideology_. ... Karl Marx [characterized it as] "they aren't aware of it, but they do it." ... Antonio Gramsci takes issue with Marx's distinction between the material and the ideal, arguing that the material itself is filtered through consciousness and the realm of ideas. ... Gramsci's notion of _hegemony_ characterizes the ability of stronger social classes to impose a worldview on subordinate ones, so that the latter see that worldview as natural. Louis Althusser built on Gramsci's interest in the way ideas connect with material practice, arguing that economic systems tend first to their own procreation. He conceives of two types of institutions that carry this out in the modern capitalist state, the Repressive State Apparatuses (RSAs), such as the police, courts, and army, and the Ideological State Apparatuses (ISAs), such as the church
, the family, and the educational system. ... [For Zizek, i]deology is not just a false representation of reality, it has become a part of reality itself, disfiguring it. ... When ideology creates distortions in reality, these deformations become increasingly difficult to see. (pp73-74)

---

> The interrelated structure of political issues suggests that procedural rhetorics may offer more promising methods for exposing political ideology than verbal rhetorics. ... When we interrogate political issues as procedural systems--as the emergent outcomes of interconnected, independent rules of cultural behavior--we can gain a unique perspective on such problems. Diana Richards has adopted the concept of "functional nonlinearity" from nonlinear modeling to describe the role of complexity in political processes. Such processes are not neat and tidy; they are, in Richards's words, a "big mess" than entails "sensitivity to small changes, nonequilibrium dynamics, the emergence of complex patterns, and sudden changes in outcomes...much less is static, stationary and fixed." ...procedural representations of political processes also engender _expression_ rather than prediction or validation. Procedural rhetorics in political videogames make claims about the particular interrelations between political processes, why they work, why they don't work, or how society might benefit by changing the rules. (p98)

> Cognitive linguists George Lakoff and Mark Johnson propose that metaphor is central to human understanding. Influenced by Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss, Clifford Geertz, and Jean Piaget, Lakoff and Johnson argue that our conceptual systems are fundamentally shaped by cultural constructions. For Lakoff and Johnson, metaphor is not a fanciful language reserved for poets, but an active framework central to how we understand the world. For example, the two unpack our understanding of "time as a commodity," showing how we relate our experience of time to monetary concepts of quantification (_you're running out of time; is that worth the time?_). Turning to politics explicitly, Lakoff argues that the most important consideration in political discourse is not how politicians respond to "facts" of the external world, but how they conceptualize or "frame" that world in their discourse about it. ... conservative political scientist Frank Luntz specializes in helping conservatives frame their spoken discourse to create the greatest appeal possible--what he calls "message development." ...he has guided conservatives on the strategic use of such terms as "war on terror" instead of "war in Iraw" and "climate change" instead of "global warming." What Lakoff calls "frames," Luntz names "contexts"--ways to repackage positions so that they carry more political currency. ...Frames or contexts are not merely theoretical structures for intellectual navel-gazing; they are operational models that are actively influencing public policy. (pp99-101)

> ...Chris Crawford's follow-up to _Balance of Power_, _Balance of the Planet_...offered a detail model of the earth's ecosystem. ...Instead of manipulating the physical environment itself, as the player does in _Sim Earth_, in _Balance of the Planet_ the player manipulates social responses to environmental conditions. For example, lowering the coal tax increases coal use, which in turn increases lung disease caused by coal pollution. (p102)

> This restructuring [of political discourse] is necessary because citizens tend to assume that language and its carriers--from politicians to news media--are neutral. The public has little purchase on the "moral conceptual systems" that underwrite verbal and written political utterances themselves.
> ...It is worth noting the urgent and somewhat desperate note on which Lakoff ends _Moral Politics_:
> > In short, public discourse as it currently exists is not very congenial to the discussion of the findings of this study. Analysis of metaphor and the idea of alternative conceptual systems are not part of public discourse. Most people don't even know that they have conceptual systems, much less how they are structured. This does not mean that the characterizations of conservatism and liberalism in this book cannot be discussed publicly. They can and should be. What requires special effort is discussing the unconscious conceptual framework behind the discussion.
> Lakoff has called this process "shifting the frame." Perhaps the most promising future political role of videogames will be to help citizens take on precisely this challenge. (pp119-120)

---

> procedural rhetoric is particularly devoted to representing, communicating, or persuading the player toward a particular biased point of view. Playing such games can have a political impact because they allow players to embody political positions and engage in political actions that many will never have previously experienced, and because they make it possible for players to deepen their understanding of the multiple causal forces that affect any given, always unique, set of historical circumstances. (p135)

> But as Raymond Williams points out [with regard to handbills and newspaper advertisements in the 16th and 17th centuries], there is a difference between the Shakespearean notion of "the process of taking or giving notice of something" and "an institutionalized system of commercial information and persuasion." (p147)

---

> [Economists Paul Milgrom and John Roberts] articulated a kind of theoretical game they called the "persuasion game" as a possible explanation for advertising logic. The persuasion game is _noncooperativev_ in game-theoretical terms--a game in which both agents interact directly, but in which one agent tries to assign values to the outcome of another agent. Persuasion games are characterized by a lack of control over events relevant to the persuading agent.
> In advertising, a classic terrain for persuasion games of the general kind, a seller may emphasize consequences of purchasing that are important to the potential consumer but not directly under the control of the seller. Examples of such games abound: advertisers claim that a particular brand of beer might increase the buyer's appeal to the opposite sex, or that a particular brand of athletic wear might radically improve the wearer's performance. In these games, the advertiser's desired outcome is left in the consumer's hands. Persuasion games also apply to representative politics, political lobbying, organizational influence activities, social influence activities, and many other domains. More abstractly, a persuasion game is a game in which an interested player dicloses information to another player, who has to make a decision that affects the payoff of the disclosing player. There are three imporatnt types of advertising that can participate in such persuasion games: _demonstrative_, _illustrative_, and _associative_ advertising.
> Demonstrative advertising provides direct information. These ads communicate tangibles about the nature of a product. This type of advertising is closely related to the product as commodity; demonstrative ads focus on the functional utility of products and services.
> ...Illustrative advertising communicates indirect information. Illustrative ads can communicate both tangibles and intangibles about a product, with a focus on the marginal utility, or the incremental benefit of buying this product of another, or over not buying at all. These ads often contextualize a product or service differently than demonstrative ads, focusing more on social and cultural context. ...[For example] the Saab ad places the car on a road and uses photographic panning to telegraph motion. No additional copy accompanies the ad, but the vehicle in motion serves to illustrate speed.
> ...Associative advertising communicates indirect information, focusing specifically on the intangibles of a product. Where demonstratiev advertising highlights the mass-market appeal of a product--the product as commodity--associative advertising focuses on its niche market appeal.
> ...Many ads function across more than one of these three registers.
> ...Associative advertising is related to a recent trend known as "lifestyle marketing." Lifestyle marketing starts from the seemingly innocuous goal of tuning advertising to address niche rather than mass markets; however, lifestyle marketing and its associative tools depend largely on new techniques for data-gathering to help identify consumers as a member of this or that "segment."

> According to early behaviorists like Edward Thorndike and B.F. Skinner, learning is about reinforcement. ... Transfer of learning...takes place via repetition and reinforcement. Reinforcement theory privileges stimulus-response learning arranged in steps to ratchet up a student's abilities. ...behaviorists have been accused of ignoring the private, mental processes inherent in individual human beings. According to this objection, materialist, empiricist understandings of learning leave no room for human subjectivity. ...With Jean Piaget, the understanding of learning became more connected to theories of mind...Piaget insisted that cognitive development entails adaptation to the environment, a founding principle of other constructivist learning theories. ...constructivist learning assumes that the learner "constructs" knowledge individually, that learning is inseparable from the learner's interaction with the environment. The more popular forms of social constructionism, founded on the theories of Lev Semenovich Vygotsky, draw particular attention to the role of social interaction in cognitive development. Social constructionism includes approaches like the Soviet activity theory that descended from Vygotsky's own contributions, as well as situated learning theory, which focuses on "learning by doing."
> ...Constructivism refocuses education on the practice of individualized cognitive development as a goal in itself, a goal not always reconnected with subject-specific learning outcomes.
> ...At the risk of oversimplification, most contemporary understandings of (formal) education fall largely in either the behaviorist or the constructionist theory of education. The "traditional" classroom relies on behaviorist learning strategies. Students practice within question/answer frames that reinforce knowledge of a subject matter. Students response (in speech or writing, for example) and receive immediate feedback in the form of positive and negative reinforcement. The behaviorist classroom assumes that reinforced behavior will recur; and because of its empiricist assumptions, such a learning environment believes that one type of positively reinforced behavior is adequate. Teacher-directed rote learning is the norm in behaviorist-influenced educational practices.
> ...In general, the contemporary behaviorist classroom is expected to function like a scientific instrument in which the successful student develops an increasingly accurate ability to reflect the veracity of the material world. That world contains facts and principles, or "learning content," which education successfully transfers into the mind of the learning through reinforcement. Constructivist approaches to education remain almost entirely confined to the arena of very early childhood. Even though this developmental period bears high cultural visibility, it is generally less controversial to allow the very young to experiment with their own emerging identities. (pp233-236)

---

> Behaviorist approaches to games foreclose what I have previously called the simulation gap, the breach between the game's procedural representation of a topic and the player's interpretation of it. Indeed, behaviorism's general tendency to ignore the individual contexts for learning fail to account for both different player contexts and the ambiguity of meaning inherent to creative artifacts of all kinds. Such an absolute appeal to scientific logic occludes cultural nuance and the subjectivity of representation (pp238-239)

> Lego christened their computer-aided brick robot-building system with the term "Mindstorms", borrowed from constructionist Seymour Paper. Mindstorms are primarily intended to teach computer programming and creative, expressive construction. While robotics are integral to the process, they serve principally as a carrot to draw child interest; the educational value of the toys is understood in terms of their potential to develop general abilities in programming and creative expression.

> rhetorical positions are always particular positions; one does not argue or express in the abstract. A game's procedural rhetoric influences the player's relationship with it by constraining the strategies that yield failure or success. (pp241-242)

---

> The surface representation or graphical skin in a game is not a mere dressing for the abstract rules, such that any particular presentation of a procedural model is essentially arbitrary and dispensable. ... Game designer Raph Koster offers an even stronger example. Koster imagines a hypothetical reskinning of the classic puzzle game _Tetris_. This new version replaces the game's abstract tetrominoes with dead bodies contorted into different shapes. The abstract playfield of _Tetris_ becomes a mass grave, and the game itself becomes a simulation of genocide. Koster explains:
> > You the player are dropping innocent victims down into the gas chamber, and they come in all shapes and sizes. There are old ones and young ones, fat ones and tall ones. As they fall to the bottom, the grab onto each other and try to form human pyramids to get to the top of the well. Should they manage to get out, the game is over and you lose. But if you pack them tightly enough, the ones on the bottom succumb to the gas and die.
> The abstract goals of the two games remain the same...But the adoption of a new context for identical rules changes the game from a harmless puzzle into amorally debatable cultural object. As Koster says of the hypothetical Holocaust simulator, "I do not want to play this game. Do you? Yet, it is _Tetris_." ... as Koster puts it, "the bare mechanics of the game do not determine its semantic freight." (pp242-243)

> ... procedural literacy is not just a practice of technical mastery, but one of technical-cultural mastery. ...procedural literacy should not be limited to the _abstract_ ability to understand procedural representations of cultural values. Rather, it should use such an understanding to interrogate, critique, and use _specific_ representations of _specific_ real or imagined processes. (pp245-256)

This body of work argues that humans don't often think best when they attempt to reason via logic and general abstract principles detached from experience>
> ...the basic premise of situated cognitivism still occludes the _type of experience_ that intersects with _specific_ abstract principles. Gee continues,
> > Rather [than via abstract principles], they think best when they reason on the basis of patterns they have picked up through their actual experiences in the world, patterns that, over time, can become generalized but that are still rooted in specific areas of experience.
> It is precisely _specific areas of experience_ that have been expunged from our understanding of constructivist learning and procedural literacy in particular; it is also the corrective for the practice of divorcing subject specificity from learning. (p250)

> To distinguish videogames from narrative media, Heather Chaplin and Aaron Ruby argue that the former use models, whereas the latter use descriptions. As an example, the two compare learning the orbits of planets from textbook or lecture descriptions versus learning from an orrery, a mechanical model of the planets on a system of gears that models their rotations and orbits at the correct relative velocities. The orrery, explain Chaplin and Ruby, "represents the solar system not by _describing_ it but by serving as a _model_ of it." Models that depict behavior, like an orrery, facilitate experimentation, a more formal kind of procedural play where the rules of the mechanical system constrain manipulation of the device. (pp257-258)

> ...videogame players develop procedural literacy through interacting with the abstract models of specific real or imagined processes presented in the games they play.

(p260)

> Distrust of educational institutions is not unique to twentieth- and twenty-first-century postindustrialism. In 1869, John Stuart Mill offered a similar argument:
> > A general State education is a mere contrivance for moulding people to be exactly like one another; and the mould in which it casts them is that which pleases the predominant power in the government--whether this be a monarch, a priesthood, an aristocracy, or the majority of the existing generation; in proportion as it is efficient and successful, it establishes despotism over the mind, leading by natural tendency to one over the body.
> We might summarize the distinction as one of being _schooled_ versus _educated_. Being schooled means becoming expert in the actual process of schooling, the requirements and conditions of doing well in school, so as to ratchet up in the system. Being schooled means understanding how to stand in line, how to speak when acknowledged, and how to follow directions. ... By contrast, being educated means becoming expert in human improvement, so as to ratchet up in life itself. Being educated means being literate in the fundamental operation of a knowledge domain, knowing how to advance arguments, how to think independently, and how to express and improve oneself. Being educated means understanding how to disrupt a system with new improvements.
> When schooling takes place in corporations or other enterprises, we usually call it _training_. (pp262-263)

---

> ...schooling is tightly bound to consumption. At the 2004 MIT-sponsored Education Arcade conference, critic and veteran educational software designer Brenda Laurel launched into a brisk harangue on the subject, which I paraphrase here:
> > School teaches basic skills. Starting in the twentieth-century, school provides socialization and, more importantly, babysitting while parents go to work. School teaches test-taking behavior. And school teaches about authority: teachers know more and have more power; students have no power. Students' ability to express agency is limited to "petty transgressions" or "achievements of excellence" within the structure provided by the school.
> > The teaching of hierarchy is the primary function of public education in America--designed to create an efficient underclass. School trains kids to be good workers and buyers...
> > Public education does not teach young people to meaningfully exercise personal agency, to think critically, to use their voices, to engage in discourse, or to be good citizens.
> These arguments trace a broader trend made most famous by Louis Althusser, who cited the education system as the most important example of "ideological state apparatuses" (ISAs), state institutions that function specifically to reproduce the process of production. (pp263-264)
