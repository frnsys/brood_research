# Castelfranchi, C., & Guerini, M. (2007). Is it a promise or a threat?. Pragmatics & Cognition, 15(2), 277-311.

A promise/threat is a communication act where $x$ declares something about a future event that is presupposed to be under their control. It is an external declaration of intent, which may not necessarily become accompanied by an internal commitment (i.e. someone may threaten to do something but never actually intend on carrying it out).

It is a promise if the future event is presupposed to be in favor of $y$, the recipient of the promise; otherwise, if it presupposed to be against the interests of $y$, it is a threat. With threats we also assume that the action is done without the consent of $y$.

It is up to $y$ whether or not to believe the promise/threat.

Promises/threats do not necessarily involve persuasion, though they often do. Persuasion is when $x$ threatens/promises to $y$ on a condition that is under the control of $y$. I.e. I will do $a$ if you do (or don't do) $b$.

On the other hand, we can have a conditional promise/threat that is not persuasive; i.e. if $c$ happens, I will do $a$; where $c$ is totally out of the control of $y$ (e.g. the sun rising).
