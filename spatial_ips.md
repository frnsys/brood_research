notes from: Evolutionary games and spatial chaos. Martin A. Nowak & Robert M. May (1992).

- agents arranged in a grid, which may have fixed or periodic (wrap-around) boundaries
- only two types of agents
    - those that always cooperate $C$
    - those that always defect $D$
- payoffs
    - mutual cooperation = 1
    - mutual defection = 0
    - one defects: $b$, the other gets 0
- $b$ is the only parameter
- each step
    - each agent plays against its neighbors (and it can play against itself as well)
    - then each agent adopts the strategy of the highest winner amongst its neighbors (or stays the same)
