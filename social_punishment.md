Groups may deal with the problem of free-riders by punishing them, if punishing them is cost-effective.

The model here models the evolution of punishment with two additional features absent from other work:

- "punishment is coordinated among group members so that it is contingent on the number of others predisposed to participate in the punishment"
- "punishment is characterized by increasing returns to scale, so the total cost of punishing a single free-rider declines as the number of punishers increases."

The model:

- three stages to a step:
    - signaling stage: agents that want to punish defectors can signal that with cost $q$; $q$ should be high enough such that it does not pay to signal and then fail to punish
    - cooperation stage: agents can choose to cooperate or defect
        - cooperation costs $c$ and benefits each member of the group $b/n$, where $b > c > b/n$
    - punishment stage: punishers can coordinate to inflict a cost $p$ on the target at an expected cost to each punisher of $k/n_p^a$ where $n_p$ is the number of punishers
- two strategies that agents can inherit: punisher and nonpunisher
- cooperation and free-riding are not inherited strategies; individuals make this choice based on the incentives based on punishment
- if at least $\tau, 0 \leq \tau \leq n-1$ other group members signal, punishers cooperate with probability $1-e$ and defect with probability $e$ and then punish any individual who did not cooperate.
    - if fewer than $\tau$, they all defect and do not punish
- nonpunishers do not signal, defect, and do no t punish, but are punished if there are at least $\tau + 1$ punishers in the group
- after punishment, both types cooperate with probability $1-e$ and defect with probability $e$ if defectors were punished the last time a defection occurred
- the cost of being punished (to the target) is $p$, which should be greater than the next cost of cooperating, $c - b/n$
- then individuals reproduce at a rate that is proportional to their payoff as compared with the population average payoff (evolve)
