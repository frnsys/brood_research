# Goldhamer, H., & Speier, H. (1959). [Some observations on political gaming](http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2008/P1679.pdf). World Politics, 12(01), 71-83.

This paper details political games carried out by RAND's Social Science Division.

The games were played four times with varying degrees of time invested, between 1955-1956. The paper focuses on the fourth game since it was the most substantial and players devoted their full time to it.

- previous games used the present as their starting point, but they became too tangled with ongoing news
- this game started in the future (January 1, 1957) starting with a scenario projected from the present
- it "focused on the activities of the US and the [Soviet Union] with respect to each other and to Western Europe"
- it went until the in-game summer of 1957
- was played over three real-time weeks

- games to simulate international scenarios
- one or more players represented a government of a country
    - not all countries were represented, "only those regarded as most significant for the geographical or problem are around which the game was centered"
- one or more players also represented "Nature"
    - "the role of 'Nature' was to provide for events of the type that happen in the real world but are not under control of any government: certain technological developments, the death of important people, non-governmental political action, famines, popular disturbances, etc."
- participants were specialists; other specialists were brought in as needed
- all non-US governments had to play "in the manner they judged 'their' governments would behave in the circumstances prevailing at any given time of the game" (called the "predicted strategy") (these players were experts in their respective countries)
- the US team, being the subject of the experiment, did not have such a restriction
- there was also a team of referees
    - these referees were part of the "Nature" team
    - they also ruled on the feasibility of each move: "they were to disallow any move that they did not regard as within the constitutional or physical power of the government proposing it."
    - "For example, the referees could introduce [evaluations of the state of affairs] in the form of press roundups, trade union resolutions, intelligence reports, speeches made in the united Nations, etc."
    - the government players could also challenge the plausibility of these referee actions

Procedure:

- all government teams made moves in written form and submitted them to the referees
    - these teams must also state to the referees their motives for their moves and the expectations behind them
- some moves were "open" and visible by all, others were "game classified"
    - "The referees determined the distribution of each player [that described moves] and, as controllers of information, could 'leak' the contents of 'game classified' papers, in whole or in part, sooner or later, accurately or in distorted form"
- some parts of the initial scenario were also "game classified"


> the game provided, through its sequence of moves and counter-moves, a "calculation" of consequences (anticipated and unanticipated). In this respect, the political game is somewhat similar to the use of Monte Carlo methods whereby machine simulation takes over the job of a purely mathematical derivation of results.

> It should not be supposed, however, that the political game displaces customary forms of intellectual collaboration such as the writing of political analyses...On the contrary, we found that one of the most useful aspects of the political game was its provision of an orderly framework within which a great deal of written analysis and discussion took place. In describing our experience to others we have continually emphasized that discussion, orally or in written form, of political problems that arise during the game is one of its most valuable features.

> We did not expect and we have not so far found that the political game enables us to test strategies or to forecast political developments with any real degree of confidence. ... On the other hand, our experience does show that even though an over-all strategy may not be tested (in terms of a clear payoff) by a single game, players do become aware during the game of pitfalls and problems that surround a strategy or some aspect of it.

The game "provided a very real stimulus to political inventiveness and a keen realization of possible contingencies that in analytical work might have seemed less important or less likely."

> ...probably the major benefit lay in the fact that the game served to suggest research priorities for problems of which we were already aware and to define these problems in a manner that would make the research more applicable to policy and action requirements.

> We believed when we began our work in gaming that the political game would prove to be a useful educational device. Our experience (and that of academic institutions with which we have collaborated) has increased our conviction in this regard.
