Elsenbroich, Corinna (2012) 'Explanation in Agent-Based Modelling: Functions, Causality or Mechanisms?' Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation 15 (3) 1 <http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/15/3/1.html>. doi: 10.18564/jasss.1958

Realist accounts of explanation between two states $S_1 \to S_n$ can be classified roughly as:

- _Covering law explanations_: provides a _general law_ describing how $S_1$ transitions to $S_n$
- _Causal explanations_: provides a complete account of a particular event, step-by-step, i.e. $S_1, S_2, \dots, S_{n-1}, S_n$. Causal explanations are difficult if not impossible in social science "as we can never really be sure we have identified all the real entities and mechanisms at work". Hence we can focus on mechanistic explanations (below) which don't require a comprehensive identification of all contributing factors.
- _Mechanistic explanations_: a causal explanation which is not complete - "lay[s] open the 'cogs and wheels' operating to produce the phenomenon in question" (in contrast to "black-box" statistical correlations)
- _Unifying explanations_: provides a _general theory_ for a group of phenomena (e.g. theory of evolution explains both the human brain and a bird's feathers)

For example, Schelling's model of segregation does not provide a complete causal explanation of segregation; there are likely many other variables at play. But it does explain a particular _mechanism_ for it. "It is clear that the Schelling model does not tell the whole story of segregation but it shows that segregation _can be caused_ by the possibility of movement even at very high tolerance thresholds."

This is _adbuctive reasoning_, which involves finding the "most likely explanation" from a set of observations. That is, `b` _could_ explain phenomenon `a` (it is sufficient) but there are other such plausible explanations (`b` is not necessarily the explanation for `a`).

The "symmetry thesis" essential states that; "if we can predict a phenomenon to occur, we know what brings it about and thus have explained it."

> Prediction is a thorn in the side of ABM. Models claim to replicate processes of the real world but no detailed prediction has ever been derived from an ABM.[4] One important reason why ABM are expected to predict is that traditionally, prediction is what simulations are for. Two examples of simulations were discussed in earlier sections, the crash-test car simulation and the climate model. The car crash simulation is devised solely to simulate the exact procedure of the car crash, thus predicting the exact impact of the crash on the car. Its purpose is to predict so that the real world car can be improved. This predictive power is achieved by the full knowledge of the causal interconnections of the car (of its structure, its materials, etc.).

> The climate model also started off as a truthful mechanistic system. The initial programming was according to the laws supposedly underlying the system. The simulation 'exploded', rendering the truthful representation useless for prediction. Some falsifying assumptions were made until finally the simulation retrodicted historic data adequately. The reason for the simulation is to predict future climate development. Given the falsified assumptions we do not believe this prediction due to the exact replication of the processes in the climate system as was the case in the crash test dummy example. Here we believe the prediction because of the fit of historic data, its successful retrodiction. We could call this an inductive prediction. The difference between inductive and causal prediction is well made in Troitzsch (2009).

> In a recent discussion of the epistemology of ABM, Epstein (2008) deliberately cuts the cord between prediction and explanation, saying that there are many other reasons to model. He is certainly right in saying that prediction is not the sole justification of a model, in particular prediction as commonly defined in the natural sciences, i.e. predicting at a pretty detailed level what happens to a system or parts of a system in the future. Against this rather defensive position, Thompson and Derr (2009) argue that explanation and prediction must not and need not be divorced, only the notion of prediction needs to be widened to include more general predictions, such as "earthquakes happen" as a prediction of tectonic plate theory. Troitzsch (2009) makes an important distinction between three levels of specificity of predictions. He also distinguishes between stochastic and deterministic predictions. His solution to the debate on prediction and explanation is that any good explanation will yield at least a prediction of type one:

> Troitzsch's reply to Thompson and Derr's weakening of the notion of prediction to the prediction "earthquakes occur" from plate tectonics is that humanity will know that fact after experiencing the first earthquake without needing any theory at all.

> Let us imagine a scenario: There is a competition to draw an imaginary climate curve up to the timespan between 2000 BC to 3000 AD. Let us presume we match the curves to the real data and then select the one that is the closest fit in terms of retrodiction. Would we be in any way justified to presume that the future prediction is true? We clearly would not. Does it mean that it is necessarily false? Certainly not, but a match would be pure luck (or some supernatural clairvoyance on the part of the curve maker).
> We might have prediction without the underlying mechanism but no reason to believe it is true.

> Let us look at an example. In Gilbert et al. (2008) an agent-based model of the English housing market is developed. In this model there are agents acting as buyers, sellers and realtors (estate agents) according to different goals and intentions, leading to different roles in market interactions. The environment is a grid with houses of initially random values. The agents also have different incomes and savings and are on different steps of the housing ladder (e.g. first time buyers). The model implements a host of economic variables, such as interest rates, inflation, Gini index etc. One of the most interesting outcomes of the model is that the level of interest rates has much less influence on house prices than for example the number of first time buyers entering the market. The model was published in 2008 and shortly afterwards the banking crisis was followed by a (slight) housing crash; and the lack of first time buyers contributed to this crash as banks suddenly wanted a large deposit for mortgages, at least for mortgages at reasonable interest rates, resulting in many people no longer being able to afford to enter the market as first time buyers leading to many properties staying on the market for longer until sellers reduced the price. The model of the housing market did not predict a housing market crash due to a lack of first time buyers but it helps to investigate the influence of different parameters, such as interest rates, first time buyers, etc. on house prices.

> Mechanism explanations give us an account of how a system works, a set of patterns in particular contexts. By invoking the entities and activities at work, we can work out what will happen in similar contexts containing such entities and activities. They help us to generate predictions which can be tested in experimental settings and, if the predictions are false, the mechanism framework requires one to figure out which mechanism was at fault (see Douglas 2009 for a discussion on mechanism explanations and prediction).
